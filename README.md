# Emergency MicroCell Mesh Network

Emergency communication that works when everything else fails.

This is a complete offline communication system I built for disaster response scenarios where traditional cellular and internet networks are unavailable.

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

**This is a personal, non-profit humanitarian technology project developed independently in my spare time. This project is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to any organization. It is developed as a humanitarian technology initiative with no commercial interests, intended to contribute to global emergency response capabilities.**

## The Problem

During Cyclone Mocha in Bangladesh, I witnessed firsthand how traditional communication networks fail when disasters strike. Cellular networks went down immediately, leaving thousands of people unable to call for help or coordinate relief efforts. This experience highlighted a critical gap in emergency response infrastructure that affects humanitarian operations worldwide.

## The Solution

I developed the **Emergency MicroCell Mesh Network** - a robust, offline-first communication system designed for humanitarian emergency response:

- **25km coverage** using 5 LoRa mesh nodes with self-healing network topology
- **Multi-device compatibility** - works with both smartphones and basic phones
- **Real-time aid verification** - instant voucher validation for distribution systems
- **Emergency SOS messaging** - immediate help requests with location tracking
- **Cost-effective deployment** - $800 per node with 6+ month battery life
- **Scalable architecture** - designed for rapid deployment in disaster zones

## How It Works

### For People in Need
- Smartphone users get a full emergency app interface
- Basic phone users can send SMS through a LoRa bridge (no cellular network needed)
- Anyone can send emergency SOS messages with their location
- Everyone receives real-time emergency alerts

### For Shop Owners
- Instantly verify if aid vouchers are valid
- Send emergency messages if they need support or security
- Get clear instructions on whether to provide food or not

### For Emergency Coordinators
- Monitor the entire microcell network in real-time
- See all emergency messages and coordinate responses
- Send broadcast alerts to everyone in the area
- Connect to existing aid distribution systems

## Technical Overview

### Network Coverage
- 5 microcell nodes covering 25km x 25km area
- Each node covers 5km radius
- Uses LoRaWAN 433MHz with mesh networking

### Technology Stack
- Backend: Python Flask
- Frontend: Mobile-responsive web interface
- Hardware: Raspberry Pi + LoRa modules
- Languages: English and Bengali support
